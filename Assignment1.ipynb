        "At the beginning of the assignment I had an idea about using CBOW model as a main solution algorithm. It was about using CBOW weights in order to predict the misspelled word based on its context words and then comparing it to correction candidates. However, the idea failed miserably not even reaching the baseline level of Norvig's super simple frequency-based implementation. I spent around 3 full days trying to make it work(some solutions were crazy enough to send me to the asylum) and had quite a lot of fun with it, but then just used a BERT model instead and got a much better accuracy after writing code for just a couple of hours. I am not sure if you are interested in an awful word2vec implementation, but I will share it anyway)"

        "This is based on the mentioned idea about calculating CBOW embeddings for predicting the most alike corrections. Since the number of context words varies significantly, we cannot just predict the embedding well, making it necessary to get the mean embedding of the context words. Probably it is possible to make it work this way with adding special tokens instead of missing words(for example when the misspelled word is located at the end of a sentence), but I did not get good results while trying to implement it, mainly because it takes a lot of time to train meaninful embeddings while making little changes. (less than 50 epochs is useless on this dataset, more than 50 epochs takes more than 3 hous to train)"
